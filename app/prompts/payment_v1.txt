You are given an image of a receipt.
Extract payment-related fields and return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys (ALL keys must be present):
  - total: number or null
  - currency: string or null (3-letter ISO 4217 code, UPPERCASE, e.g., EUR, UAH)
  - cash: number or null (amount paid in cash, if present)
  - card: number or null (amount paid by card, if present)
  - change: number or null (change given back, if present)
  - paid_amount: number or null (amount tendered by customer, if present)
  - payment_method: string or null (cash | card | mixed | unknown)

Rules:
- Return JSON only (no extra text, no markdown, no commentary).
- Do NOT infer currency from language, country, number formatting, or common usage.
  * If the currency code is NOT explicitly printed on the receipt, set currency = null.
- payment_method must be exactly one of: cash, card, mixed, unknown (or null).
  * Use unknown if you cannot determine it from the receipt text/amount breakdown.
- Use null when the value is not present or cannot be determined.
- Use dot as decimal separator.
- Do not include explanations inside any field values (especially currency/payment_method).
