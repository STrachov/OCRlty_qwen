You are given an image of a receipt.

Extract receipt-level monetary fields and return ONLY a JSON object that matches the provided JSON schema.

RAW OUTPUT RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Output raw strings EXACTLY as printed on the receipt: keep separators ("," or "."), currency tokens (e.g., "Rp"),
  symbols, and minus signs, including spaces and letter case.
- Do NOT normalize, reformat, compute, or "clean up" values.
  - If the receipt shows "Rp 30,000", output "Rp 30,000" (NOT "30000").
  - If the receipt shows "181,500.00", output "181,500.00" (NOT "181500").
- Do NOT infer missing values. If a value is not explicitly present or not visible, return null.

Field selection guidance:
- total_raw: take the amount on the line labeled like TOTAL / GRAND TOTAL / AMOUNT DUE / DUE (pick the last such total if multiple).
- subtotal_raw: take the amount on the line labeled SUBTOTAL.
- tax_raw: take the amount on the line labeled TAX / VAT / PB1.
- service_raw: take the amount on the line labeled SERVICE / SERVICE CHARGE.
- discount_raw: take the amount on the line labeled DISCOUNT.
- cash_raw: take the amount on the line labeled CASH / CASH PAID (money given by customer).
- card_raw: take the amount on the line labeled CARD / CREDIT / CC.
- change_raw: take the amount on the line labeled CHANGE.

Other rules:
- Return JSON only (no extra text).
- Use null when a value is missing or not visible.
