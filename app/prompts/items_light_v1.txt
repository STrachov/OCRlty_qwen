You are given an image of a receipt.

Extract purchased items and return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:

- items: array of objects, each with:
    - name: string or null
    - qty_raw: string or null        # raw quantity text exactly as printed (e.g., "1x", "x1", "1 X", "1 x")
    - unit_price_raw: string or null # raw unit price exactly as printed (e.g., "@20.000", "Rp 30,000", "289000")
    - line_total_raw: string or null # raw line total exactly as printed (e.g., "58,000", "36.000", "181,500.00")

RAW OUTPUT RULES (IMPORTANT):
- Output raw strings EXACTLY as printed on the receipt: keep separators ("," or "."), currency tokens (e.g., "Rp"),
  symbols (e.g., "@"), and quantity markers (e.g., "x"), including spaces and letter case.
- Do NOT normalize, reformat, compute, or "clean up" values.
  - If the receipt shows "@20.000", output "@20.000" (NOT "20000").
  - If the receipt shows "1 x", output "1 x" (NOT "1").
- Do NOT infer missing values. If not explicitly present, return null.

Other rules:
- Return JSON only (no extra text).
- Keep items in the order they appear on the receipt.
- Use an empty array [] for modifiers if none are present.
- Use null when a value is not present or not visible.
